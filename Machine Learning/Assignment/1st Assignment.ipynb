A machine learning algorithm is trained using a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and legitimate emails. The algorithm then extracts relevant information from each email, such as the sender’s information, the subject, the message body, and so on. It learns from the labeled dataset to identify patterns and relationships between these features and their corresponding labels (spam or legitimate). Once trained, the algorithm can use the extracted features to predict the label of new, unseen emails. If an email is predicted to be spam, it can be automatically filtered into a spam folder, saving the user’s inbox space.\n"

It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.\n",
